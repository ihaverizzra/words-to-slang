How the Scripts Work
The repository includes two main scripts:

Expanding Acronyms to Full Phrases: This AutoHotkey script detects when a user types an acronym or shorthand (like "IDK" or "FYI") and automatically replaces it with the full phrase (e.g., "IDK" becomes "I don’t know" and "FYI" becomes "For your information"). This feature works with both lowercase and uppercase versions of the acronyms.

Converting Full Phrases to Acronyms: This second script does the reverse, replacing common phrases with their respective acronyms (e.g., "Laughing out loud" becomes "LOL"). This is useful when users prefer typing quickly with abbreviations but still want to convey the full meaning.

How to Use
Installation: Install AutoHotkey if you haven’t already.
Running the Script: Double-click the script file (LOLtoSen.ahk or Phrase2LOL.ahk) to activate it. The script will run in the background, monitoring for acronyms or full phrases as you type.
Using the Expander: Start typing as usual in any text field. When the script detects an acronym (such as "BRB"), it will automatically replace it with the full phrase "Be right back."
Example Usage
Acronym Expander Example: Typing BRB, ILY and TY will automatically expand to "Be right back, I love you, and thank you."
Phrase to Acronym Example: Typing I miss you will automatically convert to IMU.

This setup helps improve typing efficiency and communication clarity, especially for users familiar with common internet acronyms and abbreviations.
